Installing CCDNComponent CrumbTrailBundle 1.x
=============================================

## Dependencies:

1. [CCDNComponent CommonBundle](https://github.com/codeconsortium/CCDNComponentCommonBundle).

## Installation:

Installation takes only 2 steps:

1. Download and install dependencies via Composer.
2. Register bundles with AppKernel.php.

### Step 1: Download and install dependencies via Composer.

Append the following to end of your applications composer.json file (found in the root of your Symfony2 installation):

``` js
// composer.json
{
    // ...
    "require": {
        // ...
        "codeconsortium/ccdn-component-crumb-trail-bundle": "dev-master"
    }
}
```

NOTE: Please replace ``dev-master`` in the snippet above with the latest stable branch, for example ``2.0.*``.

Then, you can install the new dependencies by running Composer's ``update``
command from the directory where your ``composer.json`` file is located:

``` bash
$ php composer.phar update
```

### Step 2: Register bundles with AppKernel.php.

Now, Composer will automatically download all required files, and install them
for you. All that is left to do is to update your ``AppKernel.php`` file, and
register the new bundle:

``` php
// app/AppKernel.php
public function registerBundles()
{
    $bundles = array(
		new CCDNComponent\CrumbTrailBundle\CCDNComponentCrumbTrailBundle(),
		...
	);
}
```

## Next Steps.

Installation should now be complete!
